* ugrade docker and start using ARG in the Dockerfile to set JENKINS_UID/GID == outer-host effective UID
  * see also TODO in run-job.sh

* Can we support a blacklist of jdk9-ea build numbers in the even that we know "latest" contains a bug impacting lucene/solr?

* Alternative to blacklisting versions: parameterize the jdk-9 build# used by the docker image
  * by default it uses latest
  * jenkins job could be configured with a specific version to override that if "latest" fails
    * just tweak the jenkins build to use an explicit known working version (ex: "b158")  
    * remove the explicit version from your jenkins job config once you know a new/working one is available
